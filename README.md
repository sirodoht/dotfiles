# dotfiles

To install, `cd` into the `dotfiles` directory and run `./install.sh`.

Consider executing `./diff.sh` before installing. It will copy the files that
would be overwritten when the installation will run. You can then use `git status`
and `git diff` to check what will change with `install.sh`.

```
./diff.sh
./install.sh
```
